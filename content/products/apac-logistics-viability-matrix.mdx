## Executive Summary
Entering the APAC logistics space requires navigating a minefield of hyper-fragmented regulations, local infrastructural deficits, and entrenched legacy operators. This matrix strips away the generic market research to show exactly which business models are surviving, and precisely why others are bleeding capital.

### What's Inside
- **Country-by-Country Survival Rates:** Analysis of Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, and Thailand.
- **The Last-Mile Trap:** Why standard unit economics fail outside Tier 1 cities and how surviving operators restructure their fleets.
- **Regulatory Chokepoints:** Foreign ownership limits, warehouse licensing timelines, and cross-border customs realities.
- **Hidden Capex:** The unmodeled costs of vehicle retrofitting, informal payments, and facility security.

## Who is this for?
Designed strictly for operators deploying capital, supply chain directors expanding into Southeast Asia, and private equity firms evaluating logistics assets in the region. If you need actionable intelligence devoid of fluff, this is your baseline.
